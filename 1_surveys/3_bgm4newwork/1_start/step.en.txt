The BGM4NW research project has focussed on occupational health measures and New Work work settings. New Work work settings describe working environments that focus on self-determination and are often organised flexibly. This tool has also been developed as part of the project to help you adopt healthy behaviour in New Work working environments.</p><p>In what follows, you will be asked a few brief questions about your working environment. Once you have answered these questions (this will take around 15 minutes), you will receive a personal profile that gives you information about your working environment, personal resources and requirements and suggests possible occupational health management measures that could be useful for you. </p><p>The tool has been developed by the team at the institute of occupational, social and preventive medicine at the University Medical Center GÃ¶ttingen for the BGM4NW project.
